This code is written in c language.It converts the value in one unit to the other.The simple logic behind this  project is to make the user select the prefered choice i.e.,Asking the 
user to enter the choice they prefered to convert and just using loops making the condition happen with simple math multiplications.In this we have divided conversions under 3 types
Temparature,mass,currency.First we take input from user for preffered choice using scanf statments,we make 3 if loops for this and we make choice of every unit under  their respective
category.For example if user selects Temperature of first choice ,2 choices are given to them farenhiet to celcius and celcius to farenhiet we maforke user to select one choice among
them using one more if ,else,else if loops,printing of result is done under every loop with the calculation required for conversion being done.This is how a simple converter is made.
